### Instructions

Write a function named `monoyerChallenge` that creates 60 <div> elements and arranges them in a 10x6 table layout. It is mandatory to use CSS Grid to define the table structure within a parent <div> container, ensuring the layout is organized and visually clear.

Each <div> should contain a letter randomly selected from the uppercase alphabet.

The font size for each letter should increase from 11px to 130px incrementally with step of 2 as you go through the 60 letters.

Set the font-weight as follows:

- The first 20 letters should have a weight of 300.
- The next 20 letters should have a weight of 400.
- The final 20 letters should have a weight of 600.
