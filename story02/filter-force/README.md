# Filter Force

Your mission in this problem is to filter through the endless sea of elements and separate the worthy from the unworthy. Using the mighty `filter` array method, you must pass each element through a test and return a new array with only those that succeed!

### Instructions:

Create a function called `filterForce` that takes two arguments:

1. An array: The sea of elements youâ€™ll be filtering through.
2. A callback function: The test that each element must pass.

The function should return a new array with elements that pass the callback function's test.

### Example:

```js
filterForce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (num) => num > 2);
// Output: [3, 4, 5]
```
