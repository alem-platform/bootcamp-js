# Mathematical Trio Challenge

Get ready to implement your own basic arithmetic operations, but without using the standard operators! You'll create three functions that handle multiplication, division, and modulo, but with a twist — you can’t use \*, /, or %.

Write three separate functions that each take two arguments, a and b, and perform basic arithmetic operations without using the corresponding operator.

### Functions to Implement:

1. multiply(a, b)
   This function should return the product of a and b without using the \* operator.

2. divide(a, b)
   This function should return the integer result of dividing a by b, without using the / operator.

3. modulo(a, b)
   This function should return the remainder when a is divided by b, without using the % operator.

### Usage Example:

```js
multiply(4, 5);
// Output: 20

divide(20, 5);
// Output: 4

modulo(20, 6);
// Output: 2
```
