# Object Twin

In the mystical world of objects, not all things that look the same are the same. Write a function called `objectTwin` that takes two objects and checks if they reference the same memory. This mission will teach you the difference between two objects pointing to the same spot in the universe.

### Example:

```js
objectTwin({ a: 1 }, { a: 1 }); // Output: false
```
