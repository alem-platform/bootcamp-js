# Threshold Defender

Not every number makes the cut! Create a function called `thresholdDefender` that filters an array of numbers, returning only those greater than a specified threshold.

### Example:

```js
thresholdDefender([10, 5, 20, 30], 15);
// Output: [20, 30] (only numbers greater than 15)

thresholdDefender([1, 7, 10], 5);
// Output: [7, 10]
```
