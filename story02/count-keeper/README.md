# The Count Keeper

In the Kingdom of Arrays, your task is to count how many times each element appears in an array. Write a function called `countKeeper` that takes an array and returns an object with the count of each elementâ€™s occurrence.

### Example:

```js
countKeeper([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3]);
// Output: { '1': 3, '2': 2, '3': 2 }

countKeeper(["apple", "banana", "apple"]);
// Output: { 'apple': 2, 'banana': 1 }
```
