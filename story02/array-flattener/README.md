# Array Flattener

Youâ€™ve been tasked with simplifying a nested array by one level. Write a function called `flattenOnce` that takes a nested array and flattens it by one level, revealing hidden treasures within. Use your array-manipulating skills to make this happen.

### Example:

```js
flattenOnce([1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, [5]]

flattenOnce([[1], [2, 3], 4]);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
