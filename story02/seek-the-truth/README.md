# The Some Sorcerer – Seeking the Truth

An ancient spell has erased the `some` method! You need to recreate it by writing a function called `someReinventor` that takes an array and a callback, returning true if at least one element passes the test—without using the built-in `some` method. Only you can bring the truth to light!

### Example Operation:

```js
someReinventor([1, 2, 3], (num) => num > 2);
// Output: true
```
