# The Count-Master â€“ Closures Unleashed

The main task is to write a function called `countMaster` that, when called, returns another function (an inner function). This inner function will maintain its own count, even after multiple invocations. Each time the inner function is called, it should increment the counter and return the updated value.

### Example Operations:

```js
const counter = countMaster();
counter(); // Output: 1
counter(); // Output: 2
counter(); // Output: 3
```

```js
const firstCounter = countMaster();
const secondCounter = countMaster();

firstCounter(); // Output: 1
firstCounter(); // Output: 2
secondCounter(); // Output: 1
```

### Function Details:

- Write a function `countMaster` that initializes a count variable at 0.
- The function returns an inner function that increments count and returns the current value.
- Ensure that the count value persists across multiple invocations of the inner function.
