# Monoyer Challenge: Changing Text Size and Colors

You need to create a [Monoyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoyer_chart) alike table according to the requrements in this problem. Yo need to create a js function called `monoyerChallenge` that displays 60 randomly selected uppercase letters, each styled in a visually dynamic way.

### Requirements:

Write a function named `monoyerChallenge` that creates 60 <div> elements.

Each <div> should contain a letter randomly selected from the uppercase alphabet.

The font size for each letter should increase from 11px to 130px incrementally with step of 2 as you go through the 60 letters.

Set the font-weight as follows:

- The first 20 letters should have a weight of 300.
- The next 20 letters should have a weight of 400.
- The final 20 letters should have a weight of 600.

After creating the <div> elements, select all even-indexed <div> elements and change their text color to `blue`.
