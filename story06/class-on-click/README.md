# Toggle Class on Click: active Class

Write a function called `toggleActiveClass` that toggles the class `active` on a <div> when it is clicked.

### Instructions:

The function should accept an element ID as an argument.
Add a click event listener to the <div>. When clicked, the class `active` should be toggled.
