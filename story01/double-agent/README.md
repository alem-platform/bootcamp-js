# Double Agent

Youâ€™ve been tasked to double the values in a series of numbers while ensuring that their original form remains untouched. As the Double Agent, your mission is to create an identical clone of the array, and only then, double the values within it.

### Instructions:

Create a function called `doubleAgent` that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array where each number has been doubled. The original array must remain unchanged.

```js
function doubleAgent(array) {
  //
}
```

### Example:

```js
doubleAgent([1, 2, 3]);
// Output: [2, 4, 6]

doubleAgent([10, 20, 30]);
// Output: [20, 40, 60]

doubleAgent([5, 15, 25]);
// Output: [10, 30, 50]
```
