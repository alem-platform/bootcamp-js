# The Equality Conundrum

Youâ€™ve stumbled upon the Abstract Equality Conundrum, where the rules of equality get a bit fuzzy. Your mission is to create a function called `abstractEquality` that used to compare two values and determine if they are abstractly equal, even if the types differ.

### Example:

```js
abstractEquality(2, "2"); // Output: true
abstractEquality(0, false); // Output: true
abstractEquality(null, undefined); // Output: true
```
