# Log the Unknown

Welcome to the JS-bootcamp, explorer! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to identify the unknown. You will be part of an elite task force tasked with scanning and classifying mysterious objects from different dimensions (a.k.a. any JavaScript value).

### Your Objective:

Create a function called logTheUnknown. This highly classified function will accept any value and log its type using advanced alien technology, codename: typeof.

### Function Details:

Target Object: Your function will receive a single input, a value from the vast multiverse (or just JavaScript).
Advanced Scanning Technology: Using the built-in typeof, your function will determine the exact type of the object.
Mission Report: The function should return a heroic message like: "Scanning complete: This is a [type]!".

### Example Mission:

```js
logTheUnknown(42);
// will return "Scanning complete: This is a number!"

logTheUnknown("hello");
// will return "Scanning complete: This is a string!"

logTheUnknown({});
// will return "Scanning complete: This is an object!"
```
