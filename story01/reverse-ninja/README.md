# Reverse Ninja – The String Assassin

You’ve been trained by the Reverse Ninjas, masters of stealth and agility. Your task: to reverse a string **WITHOUT** relying on any built-in string methods. This ancient technique must be performed entirely by hand, showing your mastery over the string arts.

### Your Objective:

Create a function called `reverseNinja` that takes a string and returns it reversed, using no built-in string methods. Only your wits and loops will get the job done.
