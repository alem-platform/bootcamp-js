# The Sum Savior – Adding with Default Power

You’ve been tasked with a simple yet powerful mission: to add two numbers, but with a twist. Create a function called `sumSavior` that accepts two numbers. If only one number is provided, the second number defaults to 20! Time to show your calculation magic.

### Example Operation:

```js
sumSavior(10); // Output: 30 (since second argument defaults to 20)
sumSavior(5, 15); // Output: 20 (normal addition)
```
