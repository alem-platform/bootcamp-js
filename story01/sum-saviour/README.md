# The Sum Savior

Youâ€™ve been tasked with a simple yet powerful problem: to add two numbers, but with a twist. Create a function called `sumSavior` that accepts two numbers. If only one number is provided, the second number defaults to 20.

### Example:

```js
sumSavior(10); // Output: 30 (since second argument defaults to 20)
sumSavior(5, 15); // Output: 20 (normal addition)
```
