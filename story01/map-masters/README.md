# Map Masters

With the legendary map method, you are tasked with applying a function to each element in an array, returning a brand-new array of transformed elements.

### Your Objective:

Create a function called `mapMasters` that takes two arguments:

1. An array: The collection of elements you will transform.
2. A callback function: The magic spell (function) that will transform each element.

The function should return a new array with the transformed values.
