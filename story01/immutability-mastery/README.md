# Immutability Mastery – The Protectors of Data Integrity

As a member of the Immutability Masters, you must learn the difference between primitive and object immutability. These tasks will teach you how to protect data from unintended changes, keeping your code safe and predictable. Time to sharpen your skills!

## Part A: Immutable Primitives – The Unchangeable Foundations

Create an object named `immutablePrimitives` where you declare several const parameters, each holding primitive values for:

- str for strings
- num for number
- bool for boolean

Attempt to change their values through object call and note why it’s impossible to alter them.

## Part B: Square Sentries – The Array Guardians

To the object created above add method called `squareSentries` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each number is squared. Ensure that the original array is not mutated, demonstrating the power of immutability.

## Part C: Append Champions – Expanding Without Destruction

Your task is to append an element to an array without altering the original array, ensuring immutability. Create another method called `appendChampion` that takes two arguments: an array and a new element. Method should return a new array with the element appended, keeping the original array intact.
