# Merge Masters

As a Merge Master, your task is to combine two arrays into one without altering the original arrays. Preserve the immutability of each array while creating a new, merged one. Mutate not!

### Instructions:

Create a function called `mergeMasters` that takes two arrays as arguments and returns a new array that contains all the elements of both, without modifying the originals.

### Example:

```js
mergeMasters([1, 2], [3, 4]);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

mergeMasters(["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]);
// Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```
