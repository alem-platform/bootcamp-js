# Merge Masters â€“ Combining Without Chaos

As a Merge Master, your task is to combine two arrays into one without altering the original arrays. Preserve the immutability of each array while creating a new, merged one. Mutate not!

### Your Objective:

Create a function called `mergeMasters` that takes two arrays as arguments and returns a new array that contains all the elements of both, without modifying the originals.
