# BigInt Brains â€“ The Titan Counters

Welcome to the league of BigInt Brains, where numbers too large for mortals must be handled with ease. Your mission is to sum two enormous integers using the arcane power of `BigInt`.

### Your Objective:

Create a function called `bigIntBrains` that takes two arguments: two large integers as strings (Numbers too big for regular computation).

The function should return the sum of the two numbers, using `BigInt` to ensure accuracy.

### Example Calculation:

```js
bigIntBrains("12345678901234567890", "98765432109876543210");
// Output: '111111111011111111100'

bigIntBrains("9007199254740991", "1");
// Output: '9007199254740992'
```
