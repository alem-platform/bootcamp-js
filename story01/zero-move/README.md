# Zero Mover â€“ The Elemental Shifter

The balance of your array is off! Write a function called `zeroMover` that moves all the zeroes in an array to the end, without altering the order of the non-zero elements. The challenge lies in shifting without disrupting the rest.

### Example Operation:

```js
zeroMover([1, 0, 2, 0, 3]);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0]

zeroMover([0, 0, 5, 6]);
// Output: [5, 6, 0, 0]
```
