Some numbers are too large to be handled with ease. You're asked to sum two enormous integers.

### Resources

[BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)

### Instructions:

Create a function called `bigIntBrains` that takes two arguments: two large numbers as strings.

The function should return the sum of the two numbers as string.

### Example:

```js
bigIntBrains("12345678901234567890", "98765432109876543210");
// Output: '111111111011111111100'

bigIntBrains("9007199254740991", "1");
// Output: '9007199254740992'
```
