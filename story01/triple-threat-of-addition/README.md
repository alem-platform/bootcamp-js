# Triple Threat of Addition

In this problem, you must master the art of adding two numbers or evaluating an expression, but here’s the twist—you’ll have to do it in three distinct ways!

1. Function Declaration: Write a classic add function using the traditional function declaration style, name function `traditionalAdd`.

2. Function Expression: Use a [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) to create a variable that holds the same add functionality, function should be called as `expressionAdd`.

3. Arrow Function: Show off your ES6 knowledge by writing the add function using an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), called as `arrowAdd`.
