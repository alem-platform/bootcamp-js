# Object Guardian – The Key Finder

In the realm of objects, every key matters—even if the value is undefined. Your task is to write a function called `keyGuardian` that takes an object and a key name, and checks if the key is present, using the in operator. The presence of the key must be true, even if its value is falsy!
