# Boolean Transcenders

You must be able to convert any value to its Boolean equivalent. From numbers to strings, objects to arrays, everything must be evaluated in terms of truthy or falsy. Your journey is to handle any value and turn it into its Boolean counterpart.

### Instructions:

Create a function called `booleanTranscender` that takes any value (primitive or object) and returns its Boolean equivalent.

### Example:

```js
booleanTranscender(0);
// Output: false

booleanTranscender("Hello");
// Output: true

booleanTranscender(null);
// Output: false
```
