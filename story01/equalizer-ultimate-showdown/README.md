# Equalizer â€“ The Ultimate Showdown

Your task is to build the Equalizer function, which will settle the debate of whether two entities are truly, strictly equal.

### Your Objective:

Create a function called `equalizer`. This function will receive two arguments, compare them using strict equality (===), and return the verdict.

### Function Details:

Target Entities: You will receive two unknown values, and your task is to evaluate whether they are strictly the same. No Sneaky Coercion: This is a battle of absolutes!

Mission Verdict: The function will return true if the entities are strictly equal, otherwise false.
