# Reduce Rangers – Unite the Elements

As a Reduce Ranger, your mission is to unite the elements into a single force using the almighty `reduce` method. You will gather the elements from an array and combine them into one powerful result. Use your skills wisely to accumulate the values based on the provided callback.

### Your Objective:

Create a function called `reduceRangers` that takes three arguments:

1. An array: The set of elements you’ll be combining.
2. A callback function: The accumulation logic.
3. An initial value: The starting point for your accumulation.

The function will return a single value, the result of combining all elements.
