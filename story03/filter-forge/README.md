# Filter Forge

In the Filter Forge, your task is to forge a custom version of the `filter` method. Create a function called `forgeFilter` that takes an array and a callback, and returns a new array with only the elements that pass the callback’s test—without using the built-in `filter` method.

### Example:

```js
forgeFilter([5, 10, 15], (num) => num > 10);
// Output: [15]
```
