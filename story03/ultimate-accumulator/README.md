# Ultimate Accumulator

Write a function called `reduceSummoner` that takes an array and a callback function to accumulate values into a single resultâ€”without using the built-in `reduce` method. Bring order to the realms once again!

### Example:

```js
reduceSummoner([1, 2, 3, 4], (acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
// Output: 10
```
