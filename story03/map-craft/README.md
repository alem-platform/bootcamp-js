# Map Craft

Welcome to Map Craft, where you craft your own `map` method from scratch. Build a function called `craftMap` that takes an array and applies a transformation to each element, returning a new arrayâ€”without using the built-in `map` method. Time to showcase your craftsmanship!

### Example:

```js
craftMap([1, 2, 3], (num) => num + 1);
// Output: [2, 3, 4]
```
