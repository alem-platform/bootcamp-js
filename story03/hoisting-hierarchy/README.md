# \*Hoisting Hierarchy

Write a function `hoistingDance` that demonstrates complex hoisting behavior involving both functions and variables. You must declare two variables and a function, all with the same name, and the function should return the value of the variable based on the hoisting rules.

### Instructions:

Declare a variable `hoist` using var after itâ€™s referenced.
Create a function with the same name as the variable, and demonstrate which one gets hoisted.
You must show how hoisting affects the execution of code and variable values.

### Example:

```js
hoistingDance();
// Output: "var hoist"
```
